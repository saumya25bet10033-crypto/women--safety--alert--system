1. Problem Statement

In many situations, women feel unsafe while travelling alone, walking at night, or being in unfamiliar places. When something feels wrong, people tend to panic and may not know what to do immediately. Calling someone or sending a message during fear becomes difficult. Because of this, a simple and quick safety solution is needed—something that works instantly without confusion.
This project aims to provide an easy tool that can send an SOS alert along with the user’s location and also give a basic idea of whether the current area is safe or r

2. Scope of the Project

This system mainly focuses on three things:

Sending an emergency SOS message with location

Detecting how safe or unsafe an area might be using a small ML model

Keeping the process extremely simple so that anyone can use it without effort


The project covers basic backend logic, a little machine learning, and optional UI elements. It does not involve advanced mobile app features or real police integration, but those can be added later.


3. Target Users

The system is designed mainly for:

Women who travel alone

College students

People who work late shifts

Anyone who wants an additional layer of safety


Basically, the system can be useful for anyone who feels the need to quickly alert someone during an uncomfortable or unsafe situation.

4. High-Level Features

One-tap SOS Alert: Sends a message to a chosen contact immediately.

Live Location Sharing: Shares the current location with the emergency contact.

Area Safety Check: Uses a small machine learning model to predict if an area is safe or unsafe.

Simple Workflow: Everything works with minimal steps so the user doesn’t get confused during emergencies.
